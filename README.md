# Flight booker

Implementation of a form that supports inpus for multiple models.

Check the Heroku live deplyoyment [here](#). (TODO)

Technical requirements:

- Search Form
  - Will send a GET request with departure/arrival airport code and flight time.
  - Only the flight time is linked to an actual Flight.
  - The real backend search/match logic isn't required to b implemented.

- Register Form
  - A single form that will create both the Users and Booking entries.
  - The form should have a nested form to create both objetcs.

Further improvements ideas:
  - Add dynamic content to the search input fields.
  - Implement a real search algorithm to find flights.
